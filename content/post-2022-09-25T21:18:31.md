The log streams feature in [Render](https://render.com) is a little bit strange. From the [docs](https://render.com/docs/log-streams#configuring-log-streams),

```
Render Log Streams forward logs from your web services,
private services, background workers, databases,
and cron jobs to any logging provider that supplies a TLS-enabled syslog drain.
```

I hooked this up with datadog and it is indeed a syslog drain across _all_ services. This means my newly setup datadog is now filled with thousands of non-application related logs. Not only now do I have to filter all these out, but also pay for them.

Surely a log streaming pipeline should have a minimum of a service-level (if not content-level) filtering as baseline features?
