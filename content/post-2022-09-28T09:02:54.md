It's not terribly hard to come up with a state-machine DSL like [aasm](https://github.com/aasm/aasm)
by hand, but the `ActiveRecord` support is very handy.

I'm using it with an `enum` against a `status` field with the following options:

```ruby
{
  column: :status,
  requires_lock: true,
  requires_new_transaction: false,
  enum: true,
  create_scopes: false
}
```


The `requires_new_transaction` is `false` to avoid landing into unnecessary nested transactions. I'll keep my transactions explicit and intentional
The `enum` allows me to play well with the Rails enum -- which already generates scopes, so I keep `create_scopes` off.

The `requires_lock` is seemingly quite handy at first glance, since I require locking rows a fair bit because of the distributed nature of the app.
But the level at which it locks is far too granular. I generally seem to require locking rows for far longer and more work than simply transitioning state and not everything can be sanely encapsulated in a `before` or `after`.
I'd rather if I could provide the library with methods that cause a state transition rather than the inverted way it currently operates (generates methods to transition for you and then locks within that event).
