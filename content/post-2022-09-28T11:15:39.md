The views currently are a hot mess, giant nested ERB templates.
I'm not convinced of jumping into [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org) yet, since the shape of this UI is so nebulous and will definitely change dramatically and I do not want to deal with more objects and more abstractions and more code at the moment.

I'll deal with the complex markup like it's 1999.
