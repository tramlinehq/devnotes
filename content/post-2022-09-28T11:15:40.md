There are a few tight, but rare-enough race-conditions lingering about and they are constantly bothering me. They just exist as `FIXMEs` in the code atm.

Most of the these seem to be solvable by pessimistic row-locks, but I'm already dreading the littering of necessary but unintuitive placements of various row-locks throughout the code-base.

Would modelling this as a pure declarative orchestrator help keep this in check?

Not sure.
