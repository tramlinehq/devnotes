When I originally kicked things off, I added a lot of big transactions around various api-call-surrounding-database-ops. This was knowingly a cheap hack to avoid bad state changes and delaying the inevitable: careful and tedious handling of errors and control-flow.

I'm now slowly refactoring things to unpack these big transactions and I realize many of them are actually unnecessary. I'm employing yet another cheap `Result` object to signify boundary-states,

```ruby
Result = Struct.new(:ok?, :error, :value, keyword_init: true)

def good_op
  Result.new(ok?: true, value: 1)
end

def bad_op
  Result.new(ok?: false, error: "Did not work")
end

operation.ok?
operation.value
operation.error
```

This is a little bit silly, because it requires _you_ to ensure that `value` is only present alongside the `ok?` and the others are falsey in the `error` case. But it is very simple and quick to get a refactor busted out.

I have used [Github::Result](https://github.com/github/github-ds#githubresult) in the past, but recently discovered [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads/1.3) -- many of these look very sensible and immediately useful. Hopefully the next step!
