I hate talking about views and view-logic because it's low-hanging fruit, but in my head the spectrum of componentizing stuff in Rails sits the following way:

1. Extract logical helpers and partials

These are generally quite a poor view abstraction, because it really is just code-reuse, not really an abstraction. It's like stuffing away code inside a `Module` and calling it a refactor. It is cheap and effective enough to start off with.

2. Presenter objects / ViewComponents

Solid ideas here. Fair bit of upfront work required and you have to be meticulous about the granularity of your components.

3. You go the SPA route and build JSX components (or whatever else is out there now in the javascripts)

I'm not convinced I'd need to do this. I think Stimulus / Hotwire is powerful enough for all our needs for the forseeable future (famous last words). I still remember the joy of ripping out all the react from a [previous codebase](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-server) I worked on and rewrote them in a much simpler, basic markup and js.
