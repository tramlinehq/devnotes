All these years of using Rails, I had no idea `has_one` did this.

![](/images/has_one.png)

More importantly with a relationship like follows,

```ruby
class Model < ActiveRecord
  has_one :build
end

class Build < ActiveRecord
  has_one_attached_file :file
end
```

If I `create_build` on `Model` if one already exists, it will:

1. Delete that `Build`, create a new one and attach it to `Model`
2. Kickoff an `ActiveStorage::PurgeJob` and delete the file from GCS/AWS

This feels highly uncomfortable, I think.
