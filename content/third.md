I think I would pay up to $20/mo for a service that would take a Twitter handle or email address of a stranger, and based on some cursory Google searches and Internet sleuthing, gave me a few-paragraphs summary of who that person is, and why they might (or might not) be interesting. I have some friends who are very good at this, but it strikes me as the kind of thing that may not be too difficult to automate and scale with language models.
